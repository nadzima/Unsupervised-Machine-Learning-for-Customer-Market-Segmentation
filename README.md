# 🎯 Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Market Segmentation 🛍️

Welcome to the wild world of **customer market segmentation**! In this project, we're diving into the fascinating universe of **unsupervised machine learning** to help marketers better understand their customers. We're using a **K-Means clustering** approach to group customers with similar characteristics—because who doesn't love a good customer cluster? 😎

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our goal is to uncover hidden patterns in customer data from a credit card company. With these insights, we can help marketers target specific customer groups with tailored campaigns—maximizing ROI and customer happiness! 💰❤️

### Dataset

We're using a credit card dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata). This dataset contains various customer attributes, such as credit limits, transaction amounts, and payment behavior. Perfect for clustering!

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

Here's how the magic happens:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🛁: We clean and standardize the data to ensure all features are on the same scale. No biased clustering on our watch!
2. **Feature Exploration** 🔍: We visualize the data to identify interesting patterns and gain initial insights.
3. **Clustering** 🤖: Using **K-Means**, we create customer clusters. How many clusters? We let the **Elbow Method** decide (spoiler alert: no elbows were harmed during the process).
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** 📉: Using **PCA**, we reduce the number of dimensions while keeping most of the variance. This helps us visualize the clusters in 2D. Fancy, right?
5. **Visualization** 🎨: We plot the clusters, showing off our hard work and the natural grouping of customers.
